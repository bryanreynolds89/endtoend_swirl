Thankfully, this pair gets all three right.<br /><br />First, they generally feel nice and are quite easy to wear. I've had some that really bothered my ear canals, but this are a good fit, snug without feeling like a plug in my ears.<br /><br />Second, sound quality is very good for earbuds. You don't get the rich, full bass of over-the-ear phones, but the sound is generally good overall, without the thin mids and tinny highs so common with earbuds. Thumbs up.<br /><br />Finally, the extra bells and whistles, such as an in-line mic and controls right on the bids are pretty nice. They're not something I need a lot, but they're a nice extra to have. In fact, for many people they are what will justify the price tag.<br /><br />Overall, thumbs up.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: Very impressed Needed a new pair of earbuds to put in my travel bag. Decided to go with these, not disappointed.<br /><br />They come in a nice box that includes a travel bag, multiple ear tips, and a 4-pole to dual 3-pole adaptor (Combo Mic/Headphone to individual Mic and Headphone).<br /><br />The cables have some sort of rubberized coating. They make it feel more durable, but I would have preferred a cloth coating instead. The rubber coating likes to grab on stuff.<br /><br />The earbuds themselves feel like solid aluminum. The back ends are labelled 'L' and 'R' as you would expect. They are also slightly magnetic so you can put them together back-to-back. I am not sure if the magnetism is just because of the drivers or if they actually put magnets in the housing for this use.<br /><br />The sound is very good for $50 earbuds. Right out of the box I listened to a couple podcasts and then transitioned into some music. Highs are good, the middles are a little muddy, and the bass is very prominent. These have the sound profile you would expect from Beats or other very popular headphone brands. Listening to them for 4+ hours at a time did not fatigue my ears like other cheap earbuds I have used. Nor did they hurt my ear canals, a total win there.<br /><br />These are not going to replace my Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro's, but they are perfect to travel with. I even had a couple cases where I went to stand up from my desk and reached up to take off my DT770's forgetting I was actually using these earbuds.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: These Aren't Just for Gamers These wired earbuds address my base fixations:<br />* Muddy sound. Since my hearing began a gentle decline years ago, I’m not willing to spend more for anything that delivers quiet, understandable videos and phone conversations at low decibels.<br />* Klunky accessories. Attachments that stick out too far are a pain to retrieve from pockets. They get snagged catch on everything. That’s why I use only right-angle plugs.<br />* Long Day Comfort. I hate ill-fit cushions and buds that won’t stay in place when I’m moving.<br /><br />Outside of the items above, I’m malleable.<br /><br />I was pleased to discover that:<br />* Soft “shark-fins” do a fine job of securing the buds in ears.<br />* Kasott’s in-line mic control smoothly controlled volume, mute, and on/off (aka, answer/disconnect).<br /><br />Although flat cable is my tangle-free preference, the cladding on the Pro V1 round cable had a relatively solid feel. Its wire clip is small enough to grip the Columbia label on my shirt pocket.<br /><br />The earbuds performed nicely with Android phones, Windows laptops and my Anker PowerConf S3; however, they did not work with my belt-mount voice amp. (I know, I know. The amp needs a mono connection.)<br /><br />I haven’t had these long enough to comment on durability, beyond the visible build quality. Fit and finish are impressive.<br /><br />Regarding Gaming: I don’t. Sorry.<br /><br />All in all, these look, feel and act like above average wired earbuds should.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: These 3.5mm wired earbuds didn't disappoint my teen son. My son prefers wired earbuds over an actual headset or wireless earbuds. These work great according to my son. They fit comfortably in his ear and don't fall out. They don't irritate him. He uses them with xbox controller and his phone. The audio quality is not the greatest but definitely better than a lot of wired earbuds he has. He really likes the mic. He's soft spoken and tends to have trouble with people hearing him. He doesn't have that issue using this set of earbuds. I think these are a bit expensive but my son thinks they aren't provided they are durable. Only time will tell. I'm really happy these are 3.5mm plug as advertised and he doesn't need an adapter.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: Good deep sound To me, the bass sound is the most important and having mini drivers that are also doubling down as magnetic holds, I always call into question, but these worked just fine and I was very happy with the sound. Good deep bass and I definitely liked that it picked up the smallest sounds during gaming, I was surprisingly impressed\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: Worth the buy I was skeptical about these but man are they worth it. They are loud and have good sound quality. Perfect for shooter games.  I just cant tell you how the mic is. I never use it.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: Sound is good.

This is the perfect size to accommodate a Switch in a hard case! Great for taking it to a friend's house.  We often use the switch on car rides and needed more protection so that my 7-year-old could carry it to and from the car with fewer worries about drops. I love the size and the materials feel very quality, plus the design is adorable.  I haven't tested it but you can feel that it's been waterproofed yet it doesn't have any gross plastic smell! The padding feels good and the strap is quality nylon almost like a seatbelt.  They really went above and beyond.  Love it!<br /><br />I chose this product for free through Amazon Vine for an unbiased review and my thoughts are my own.\\n- ID: B0BTRV8DMV, review: Nice quality! Using for an Xbox I bought this for my daughter's Xbox. I liked the compartments and features better than other bags out there. I ordered yesterday and got it today! I opened it right away and tested my daughter's console and controller. Everything fits great and I feel like it's all safe inside. I would recommend this product. I have no complaints!  :)\\n- ID: B0BTRV8DMV, review: Simple effective case. It's nice to have all my PS5 stuff in one place while travelling.<br />It's not so nice to advertise in bright letters and graphics that I have all my PS5 stuff in one place.<br />It's nice to have disc storage.<br />It's not so nice to take those discs out of their cases to use it.<br />It's nice to have a place for my cords, (HDMI, power, and charging.)<br />It's not so nice that they are loose and the cables may fall out\\n- ID: B0BR7NT37B, review: Awesome Game Bag [[VIDEOID:a91558beefe08852581da0f980832c45]] I love this bag. It was more than I expected. It’s bigger than what I thought it would be and pleasantly surprised. It has two pockets for your switch and accessories, and it has an interior zippered pocket as well. My switch fit perfectly and has so much room for so much more. The charging cable fits, numerous games and so much more. It’s so roomy. The shoulder strap is adjustable which is important. All in all, I love it, and I posted plenty of photos and a video to show you the size and how great it is. I highly recommend this bag for any switch lover, especially an animal crossing lover. It’s perfect.\\n- ID: B0BTRV8DMV, review: Gets the job done on a budget. This is labeled a carrying case, but I feel it should be labeled carrying bag. It’s a little flimsy, but still holds the Ps5 and keeps it safe. Strong zipper, durable material. Not the highest quality bag, but it also costs a lot less than other options. If you’re just taking your Ps5 to a friends house or something, this is more than sufficient. I like the Ps5 logo on the outside… let’s all those Ps4 players know you’re cooler than them! 😎\\n- ID: B0BR7NT37B, review: Photo isn’t as vibrant The print isn’t as vibrant as the photos on the product show. It looks like ink is bleeding around the leaf print and it’s not as crisp as I thought it was gonna be. Overall wouldn’t repurchase again.

Thankfully, this pair gets all three right.<br /><br />First, they generally feel nice and are quite easy to wear. I've had some that really bothered my ear canals, but this are a good fit, snug without feeling like a plug in my ears.<br /><br />Second, sound quality is very good for earbuds. You don't get the rich, full bass of over-the-ear phones, but the sound is generally good overall, without the thin mids and tinny highs so common with earbuds. Thumbs up.<br /><br />Finally, the extra bells and whistles, such as an in-line mic and controls right on the bids are pretty nice. They're not something I need a lot, but they're a nice extra to have. In fact, for many people they are what will justify the price tag.<br /><br />Overall, thumbs up.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: Very impressed Needed a new pair of earbuds to put in my travel bag. Decided to go with these, not disappointed.<br /><br />They come in a nice box that includes a travel bag, multiple ear tips, and a 4-pole to dual 3-pole adaptor (Combo Mic/Headphone to individual Mic and Headphone).<br /><br />The cables have some sort of rubberized coating. They make it feel more durable, but I would have preferred a cloth coating instead. The rubber coating likes to grab on stuff.<br /><br />The earbuds themselves feel like solid aluminum. The back ends are labelled 'L' and 'R' as you would expect. They are also slightly magnetic so you can put them together back-to-back. I am not sure if the magnetism is just because of the drivers or if they actually put magnets in the housing for this use.<br /><br />The sound is very good for $50 earbuds. Right out of the box I listened to a couple podcasts and then transitioned into some music. Highs are good, the middles are a little muddy, and the bass is very prominent. These have the sound profile you would expect from Beats or other very popular headphone brands. Listening to them for 4+ hours at a time did not fatigue my ears like other cheap earbuds I have used. Nor did they hurt my ear canals, a total win there.<br /><br />These are not going to replace my Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro's, but they are perfect to travel with. I even had a couple cases where I went to stand up from my desk and reached up to take off my DT770's forgetting I was actually using these earbuds.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: These Aren't Just for Gamers These wired earbuds address my base fixations:<br />* Muddy sound. Since my hearing began a gentle decline years ago, I’m not willing to spend more for anything that delivers quiet, understandable videos and phone conversations at low decibels.<br />* Klunky accessories. Attachments that stick out too far are a pain to retrieve from pockets. They get snagged catch on everything. That’s why I use only right-angle plugs.<br />* Long Day Comfort. I hate ill-fit cushions and buds that won’t stay in place when I’m moving.<br /><br />Outside of the items above, I’m malleable.<br /><br />I was pleased to discover that:<br />* Soft “shark-fins” do a fine job of securing the buds in ears.<br />* Kasott’s in-line mic control smoothly controlled volume, mute, and on/off (aka, answer/disconnect).<br /><br />Although flat cable is my tangle-free preference, the cladding on the Pro V1 round cable had a relatively solid feel. Its wire clip is small enough to grip the Columbia label on my shirt pocket.<br /><br />The earbuds performed nicely with Android phones, Windows laptops and my Anker PowerConf S3; however, they did not work with my belt-mount voice amp. (I know, I know. The amp needs a mono connection.)<br /><br />I haven’t had these long enough to comment on durability, beyond the visible build quality. Fit and finish are impressive.<br /><br />Regarding Gaming: I don’t. Sorry.<br /><br />All in all, these look, feel and act like above average wired earbuds should.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: These 3.5mm wired earbuds didn't disappoint my teen son. My son prefers wired earbuds over an actual headset or wireless earbuds. These work great according to my son. They fit comfortably in his ear and don't fall out. They don't irritate him. He uses them with xbox controller and his phone. The audio quality is not the greatest but definitely better than a lot of wired earbuds he has. He really likes the mic. He's soft spoken and tends to have trouble with people hearing him. He doesn't have that issue using this set of earbuds. I think these are a bit expensive but my son thinks they aren't provided they are durable. Only time will tell. I'm really happy these are 3.5mm plug as advertised and he doesn't need an adapter.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: Good deep sound To me, the bass sound is the most important and having mini drivers that are also doubling down as magnetic holds, I always call into question, but these worked just fine and I was very happy with the sound. Good deep bass and I definitely liked that it picked up the smallest sounds during gaming, I was surprisingly impressed\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: Worth the buy I was skeptical about these but man are they worth it. They are loud and have good sound quality. Perfect for shooter games.  I just cant tell you how the mic is. I never use it.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: Sound is good.

This is the perfect size to accommodate a Switch in a hard case! Great for taking it to a friend's house.  We often use the switch on car rides and needed more protection so that my 7-year-old could carry it to and from the car with fewer worries about drops. I love the size and the materials feel very quality, plus the design is adorable.  I haven't tested it but you can feel that it's been waterproofed yet it doesn't have any gross plastic smell! The padding feels good and the strap is quality nylon almost like a seatbelt.  They really went above and beyond.  Love it!<br /><br />I chose this product for free through Amazon Vine for an unbiased review and my thoughts are my own.\\n- ID: B0BTRV8DMV, review: Nice quality! Using for an Xbox I bought this for my daughter's Xbox. I liked the compartments and features better than other bags out there. I ordered yesterday and got it today! I opened it right away and tested my daughter's console and controller. Everything fits great and I feel like it's all safe inside. I would recommend this product. I have no complaints!  :)\\n- ID: B0BTRV8DMV, review: Simple effective case. It's nice to have all my PS5 stuff in one place while travelling.<br />It's not so nice to advertise in bright letters and graphics that I have all my PS5 stuff in one place.<br />It's nice to have disc storage.<br />It's not so nice to take those discs out of their cases to use it.<br />It's nice to have a place for my cords, (HDMI, power, and charging.)<br />It's not so nice that they are loose and the cables may fall out\\n- ID: B0BR7NT37B, review: Awesome Game Bag [[VIDEOID:a91558beefe08852581da0f980832c45]] I love this bag. It was more than I expected. It’s bigger than what I thought it would be and pleasantly surprised. It has two pockets for your switch and accessories, and it has an interior zippered pocket as well. My switch fit perfectly and has so much room for so much more. The charging cable fits, numerous games and so much more. It’s so roomy. The shoulder strap is adjustable which is important. All in all, I love it, and I posted plenty of photos and a video to show you the size and how great it is. I highly recommend this bag for any switch lover, especially an animal crossing lover. It’s perfect.\\n- ID: B0BTRV8DMV, review: Gets the job done on a budget. This is labeled a carrying case, but I feel it should be labeled carrying bag. It’s a little flimsy, but still holds the Ps5 and keeps it safe. Strong zipper, durable material. Not the highest quality bag, but it also costs a lot less than other options. If you’re just taking your Ps5 to a friends house or something, this is more than sufficient. I like the Ps5 logo on the outside… let’s all those Ps4 players know you’re cooler than them! 😎\\n- ID: B0BR7NT37B, review: Photo isn’t as vibrant The print isn’t as vibrant as the photos on the product show. It looks like ink is bleeding around the leaf print and it’s not as crisp as I thought it was gonna be. Overall wouldn’t repurchase again.

Thankfully, this pair gets all three right.<br /><br />First, they generally feel nice and are quite easy to wear. I've had some that really bothered my ear canals, but this are a good fit, snug without feeling like a plug in my ears.<br /><br />Second, sound quality is very good for earbuds. You don't get the rich, full bass of over-the-ear phones, but the sound is generally good overall, without the thin mids and tinny highs so common with earbuds. Thumbs up.<br /><br />Finally, the extra bells and whistles, such as an in-line mic and controls right on the bids are pretty nice. They're not something I need a lot, but they're a nice extra to have. In fact, for many people they are what will justify the price tag.<br /><br />Overall, thumbs up.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: Very impressed Needed a new pair of earbuds to put in my travel bag. Decided to go with these, not disappointed.<br /><br />They come in a nice box that includes a travel bag, multiple ear tips, and a 4-pole to dual 3-pole adaptor (Combo Mic/Headphone to individual Mic and Headphone).<br /><br />The cables have some sort of rubberized coating. They make it feel more durable, but I would have preferred a cloth coating instead. The rubber coating likes to grab on stuff.<br /><br />The earbuds themselves feel like solid aluminum. The back ends are labelled 'L' and 'R' as you would expect. They are also slightly magnetic so you can put them together back-to-back. I am not sure if the magnetism is just because of the drivers or if they actually put magnets in the housing for this use.<br /><br />The sound is very good for $50 earbuds. Right out of the box I listened to a couple podcasts and then transitioned into some music. Highs are good, the middles are a little muddy, and the bass is very prominent. These have the sound profile you would expect from Beats or other very popular headphone brands. Listening to them for 4+ hours at a time did not fatigue my ears like other cheap earbuds I have used. Nor did they hurt my ear canals, a total win there.<br /><br />These are not going to replace my Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro's, but they are perfect to travel with. I even had a couple cases where I went to stand up from my desk and reached up to take off my DT770's forgetting I was actually using these earbuds.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: These Aren't Just for Gamers These wired earbuds address my base fixations:<br />* Muddy sound. Since my hearing began a gentle decline years ago, I’m not willing to spend more for anything that delivers quiet, understandable videos and phone conversations at low decibels.<br />* Klunky accessories. Attachments that stick out too far are a pain to retrieve from pockets. They get snagged catch on everything. That’s why I use only right-angle plugs.<br />* Long Day Comfort. I hate ill-fit cushions and buds that won’t stay in place when I’m moving.<br /><br />Outside of the items above, I’m malleable.<br /><br />I was pleased to discover that:<br />* Soft “shark-fins” do a fine job of securing the buds in ears.<br />* Kasott’s in-line mic control smoothly controlled volume, mute, and on/off (aka, answer/disconnect).<br /><br />Although flat cable is my tangle-free preference, the cladding on the Pro V1 round cable had a relatively solid feel. Its wire clip is small enough to grip the Columbia label on my shirt pocket.<br /><br />The earbuds performed nicely with Android phones, Windows laptops and my Anker PowerConf S3; however, they did not work with my belt-mount voice amp. (I know, I know. The amp needs a mono connection.)<br /><br />I haven’t had these long enough to comment on durability, beyond the visible build quality. Fit and finish are impressive.<br /><br />Regarding Gaming: I don’t. Sorry.<br /><br />All in all, these look, feel and act like above average wired earbuds should.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: These 3.5mm wired earbuds didn't disappoint my teen son. My son prefers wired earbuds over an actual headset or wireless earbuds. These work great according to my son. They fit comfortably in his ear and don't fall out. They don't irritate him. He uses them with xbox controller and his phone. The audio quality is not the greatest but definitely better than a lot of wired earbuds he has. He really likes the mic. He's soft spoken and tends to have trouble with people hearing him. He doesn't have that issue using this set of earbuds. I think these are a bit expensive but my son thinks they aren't provided they are durable. Only time will tell. I'm really happy these are 3.5mm plug as advertised and he doesn't need an adapter.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: Good deep sound To me, the bass sound is the most important and having mini drivers that are also doubling down as magnetic holds, I always call into question, but these worked just fine and I was very happy with the sound. Good deep bass and I definitely liked that it picked up the smallest sounds during gaming, I was surprisingly impressed\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: Worth the buy I was skeptical about these but man are they worth it. They are loud and have good sound quality. Perfect for shooter games.  I just cant tell you how the mic is. I never use it.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: Sound is good.

This is the perfect size to accommodate a Switch in a hard case! Great for taking it to a friend's house.  We often use the switch on car rides and needed more protection so that my 7-year-old could carry it to and from the car with fewer worries about drops. I love the size and the materials feel very quality, plus the design is adorable.  I haven't tested it but you can feel that it's been waterproofed yet it doesn't have any gross plastic smell! The padding feels good and the strap is quality nylon almost like a seatbelt.  They really went above and beyond.  Love it!<br /><br />I chose this product for free through Amazon Vine for an unbiased review and my thoughts are my own.\\n- ID: B0BTRV8DMV, review: Nice quality! Using for an Xbox I bought this for my daughter's Xbox. I liked the compartments and features better than other bags out there. I ordered yesterday and got it today! I opened it right away and tested my daughter's console and controller. Everything fits great and I feel like it's all safe inside. I would recommend this product. I have no complaints!  :)\\n- ID: B0BTRV8DMV, review: Simple effective case. It's nice to have all my PS5 stuff in one place while travelling.<br />It's not so nice to advertise in bright letters and graphics that I have all my PS5 stuff in one place.<br />It's nice to have disc storage.<br />It's not so nice to take those discs out of their cases to use it.<br />It's nice to have a place for my cords, (HDMI, power, and charging.)<br />It's not so nice that they are loose and the cables may fall out\\n- ID: B0BR7NT37B, review: Awesome Game Bag [[VIDEOID:a91558beefe08852581da0f980832c45]] I love this bag. It was more than I expected. It’s bigger than what I thought it would be and pleasantly surprised. It has two pockets for your switch and accessories, and it has an interior zippered pocket as well. My switch fit perfectly and has so much room for so much more. The charging cable fits, numerous games and so much more. It’s so roomy. The shoulder strap is adjustable which is important. All in all, I love it, and I posted plenty of photos and a video to show you the size and how great it is. I highly recommend this bag for any switch lover, especially an animal crossing lover. It’s perfect.\\n- ID: B0BTRV8DMV, review: Gets the job done on a budget. This is labeled a carrying case, but I feel it should be labeled carrying bag. It’s a little flimsy, but still holds the Ps5 and keeps it safe. Strong zipper, durable material. Not the highest quality bag, but it also costs a lot less than other options. If you’re just taking your Ps5 to a friends house or something, this is more than sufficient. I like the Ps5 logo on the outside… let’s all those Ps4 players know you’re cooler than them! 😎\\n- ID: B0BR7NT37B, review: Photo isn’t as vibrant The print isn’t as vibrant as the photos on the product show.

Thankfully, this pair gets all three right.<br /><br />First, they generally feel nice and are quite easy to wear. I've had some that really bothered my ear canals, but this are a good fit, snug without feeling like a plug in my ears.<br /><br />Second, sound quality is very good for earbuds. You don't get the rich, full bass of over-the-ear phones, but the sound is generally good overall, without the thin mids and tinny highs so common with earbuds. Thumbs up.<br /><br />Finally, the extra bells and whistles, such as an in-line mic and controls right on the bids are pretty nice. They're not something I need a lot, but they're a nice extra to have. In fact, for many people they are what will justify the price tag.<br /><br />Overall, thumbs up.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: Very impressed Needed a new pair of earbuds to put in my travel bag. Decided to go with these, not disappointed.<br /><br />They come in a nice box that includes a travel bag, multiple ear tips, and a 4-pole to dual 3-pole adaptor (Combo Mic/Headphone to individual Mic and Headphone).<br /><br />The cables have some sort of rubberized coating. They make it feel more durable, but I would have preferred a cloth coating instead. The rubber coating likes to grab on stuff.<br /><br />The earbuds themselves feel like solid aluminum. The back ends are labelled 'L' and 'R' as you would expect. They are also slightly magnetic so you can put them together back-to-back. I am not sure if the magnetism is just because of the drivers or if they actually put magnets in the housing for this use.<br /><br />The sound is very good for $50 earbuds. Right out of the box I listened to a couple podcasts and then transitioned into some music. Highs are good, the middles are a little muddy, and the bass is very prominent. These have the sound profile you would expect from Beats or other very popular headphone brands. Listening to them for 4+ hours at a time did not fatigue my ears like other cheap earbuds I have used. Nor did they hurt my ear canals, a total win there.<br /><br />These are not going to replace my Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro's, but they are perfect to travel with. I even had a couple cases where I went to stand up from my desk and reached up to take off my DT770's forgetting I was actually using these earbuds.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: These Aren't Just for Gamers These wired earbuds address my base fixations:<br />* Muddy sound. Since my hearing began a gentle decline years ago, I’m not willing to spend more for anything that delivers quiet, understandable videos and phone conversations at low decibels.<br />* Klunky accessories. Attachments that stick out too far are a pain to retrieve from pockets. They get snagged catch on everything. That’s why I use only right-angle plugs.<br />* Long Day Comfort. I hate ill-fit cushions and buds that won’t stay in place when I’m moving.<br /><br />Outside of the items above, I’m malleable.<br /><br />I was pleased to discover that:<br />* Soft “shark-fins” do a fine job of securing the buds in ears.<br />* Kasott’s in-line mic control smoothly controlled volume, mute, and on/off (aka, answer/disconnect).<br /><br />Although flat cable is my tangle-free preference, the cladding on the Pro V1 round cable had a relatively solid feel. Its wire clip is small enough to grip the Columbia label on my shirt pocket.<br /><br />The earbuds performed nicely with Android phones, Windows laptops and my Anker PowerConf S3; however, they did not work with my belt-mount voice amp. (I know, I know. The amp needs a mono connection.)<br /><br />I haven’t had these long enough to comment on durability, beyond the visible build quality. Fit and finish are impressive.<br /><br />Regarding Gaming: I don’t. Sorry.<br /><br />All in all, these look, feel and act like above average wired earbuds should.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: These 3.5mm wired earbuds didn't disappoint my teen son. My son prefers wired earbuds over an actual headset or wireless earbuds. These work great according to my son. They fit comfortably in his ear and don't fall out. They don't irritate him. He uses them with xbox controller and his phone. The audio quality is not the greatest but definitely better than a lot of wired earbuds he has. He really likes the mic. He's soft spoken and tends to have trouble with people hearing him. He doesn't have that issue using this set of earbuds. I think these are a bit expensive but my son thinks they aren't provided they are durable. Only time will tell. I'm really happy these are 3.5mm plug as advertised and he doesn't need an adapter.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: Good deep sound To me, the bass sound is the most important and having mini drivers that are also doubling down as magnetic holds, I always call into question, but these worked just fine and I was very happy with the sound. Good deep bass and I definitely liked that it picked up the smallest sounds during gaming, I was surprisingly impressed\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: Worth the buy I was skeptical about these but man are they worth it.

This is the perfect size to accommodate a Switch in a hard case! Great for taking it to a friend's house.  We often use the switch on car rides and needed more protection so that my 7-year-old could carry it to and from the car with fewer worries about drops. I love the size and the materials feel very quality, plus the design is adorable.  I haven't tested it but you can feel that it's been waterproofed yet it doesn't have any gross plastic smell!

It was more than I expected. It’s bigger than what I thought it would be and pleasantly surprised. It has two pockets for your switch and accessories, and it has an interior zippered pocket as well. My switch fit perfectly and has so much room for so much more. The charging cable fits, numerous games and so much more. It’s so roomy. The shoulder strap is adjustable which is important. All in all, I love it, and I posted plenty of photos and a video to show you the size and how great it is. I highly recommend this bag for any switch lover, especially an animal crossing lover. It’s perfect.\\n- ID: B0BTRV8DMV, review: Gets the job done on a budget. This is labeled a carrying case, but I feel it should be labeled carrying bag. It’s a little flimsy, but still holds the Ps5 and keeps it safe. Strong zipper, durable material. Not the highest quality bag, but it also costs a lot less than other options. If you’re just taking your Ps5 to a friends house or something, this is more than sufficient. I like the Ps5 logo on the outside… let’s all those Ps4 players know you’re cooler than them! 😎\\n- ID: B0BR7NT37B, review: Photo isn’t as vibrant The print isn’t as vibrant as the photos on the product show.

Thankfully, this pair gets all three right.<br /><br />First, they generally feel nice and are quite easy to wear. I've had some that really bothered my ear canals, but this are a good fit, snug without feeling like a plug in my ears.<br /><br />Second, sound quality is very good for earbuds. You don't get the rich, full bass of over-the-ear phones, but the sound is generally good overall, without the thin mids and tinny highs so common with earbuds. Thumbs up.<br /><br />Finally, the extra bells and whistles, such as an in-line mic and controls right on the bids are pretty nice. They're not something I need a lot, but they're a nice extra to have. In fact, for many people they are what will justify the price tag.<br /><br />Overall, thumbs up.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: Very impressed Needed a new pair of earbuds to put in my travel bag. Decided to go with these, not disappointed.<br /><br />They come in a nice box that includes a travel bag, multiple ear tips, and a 4-pole to dual 3-pole adaptor (Combo Mic/Headphone to individual Mic and Headphone).<br /><br />The cables have some sort of rubberized coating. They make it feel more durable, but I would have preferred a cloth coating instead. The rubber coating likes to grab on stuff.<br /><br />The earbuds themselves feel like solid aluminum. The back ends are labelled 'L' and 'R' as you would expect. They are also slightly magnetic so you can put them together back-to-back. I am not sure if the magnetism is just because of the drivers or if they actually put magnets in the housing for this use.<br /><br />The sound is very good for $50 earbuds. Right out of the box I listened to a couple podcasts and then transitioned into some music. Highs are good, the middles are a little muddy, and the bass is very prominent. These have the sound profile you would expect from Beats or other very popular headphone brands. Listening to them for 4+ hours at a time did not fatigue my ears like other cheap earbuds I have used. Nor did they hurt my ear canals, a total win there.<br /><br />These are not going to replace my Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro's, but they are perfect to travel with. I even had a couple cases where I went to stand up from my desk and reached up to take off my DT770's forgetting I was actually using these earbuds.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: These Aren't Just for Gamers These wired earbuds address my base fixations:<br />* Muddy sound. Since my hearing began a gentle decline years ago, I’m not willing to spend more for anything that delivers quiet, understandable videos and phone conversations at low decibels.<br />* Klunky accessories. Attachments that stick out too far are a pain to retrieve from pockets. They get snagged catch on everything. That’s why I use only right-angle plugs.<br />* Long Day Comfort. I hate ill-fit cushions and buds that won’t stay in place when I’m moving.<br /><br />Outside of the items above, I’m malleable.<br /><br />I was pleased to discover that:<br />* Soft “shark-fins” do a fine job of securing the buds in ears.<br />* Kasott’s in-line mic control smoothly controlled volume, mute, and on/off (aka, answer/disconnect).<br /><br />Although flat cable is my tangle-free preference, the cladding on the Pro V1 round cable had a relatively solid feel. Its wire clip is small enough to grip the Columbia label on my shirt pocket.<br /><br />The earbuds performed nicely with Android phones, Windows laptops and my Anker PowerConf S3; however, they did not work with my belt-mount voice amp. (I know, I know. The amp needs a mono connection.)<br /><br />I haven’t had these long enough to comment on durability, beyond the visible build quality. Fit and finish are impressive.<br /><br />Regarding Gaming: I don’t. Sorry.<br /><br />All in all, these look, feel and act like above average wired earbuds should.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: These 3.5mm wired earbuds didn't disappoint my teen son. My son prefers wired earbuds over an actual headset or wireless earbuds. These work great according to my son. They fit comfortably in his ear and don't fall out. They don't irritate him. He uses them with xbox controller and his phone. The audio quality is not the greatest but definitely better than a lot of wired earbuds he has. He really likes the mic. He's soft spoken and tends to have trouble with people hearing him. He doesn't have that issue using this set of earbuds. I think these are a bit expensive but my son thinks they aren't provided they are durable. Only time will tell. I'm really happy these are 3.5mm plug as advertised and he doesn't need an adapter.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: Good deep sound To me, the bass sound is the most important and having mini drivers that are also doubling down as magnetic holds, I always call into question, but these worked just fine and I was very happy with the sound.

It was more than I expected. It’s bigger than what I thought it would be and pleasantly surprised. It has two pockets for your switch and accessories, and it has an interior zippered pocket as well. My switch fit perfectly and has so much room for so much more. The charging cable fits, numerous games and so much more. It’s so roomy. The shoulder strap is adjustable which is important. All in all, I love it, and I posted plenty of photos and a video to show you the size and how great it is. I highly recommend this bag for any switch lover, especially an animal crossing lover. It’s perfect.\\n- ID: B0BTRV8DMV, review: Gets the job done on a budget. This is labeled a carrying case, but I feel it should be labeled carrying bag. It’s a little flimsy, but still holds the Ps5 and keeps it safe. Strong zipper, durable material. Not the highest quality bag, but it also costs a lot less than other options. If you’re just taking your Ps5 to a friends house or something, this is more than sufficient. I like the Ps5 logo on the outside… let’s all those Ps4 players know you’re cooler than them! 😎\\n- ID: B0BR7NT37B, review: Photo isn’t as vibrant The print isn’t as vibrant as the photos on the product show. It looks like ink is bleeding around the leaf print and it’s not as crisp as I thought it was gonna be. Overall wouldn’t repurchase again. It also arrived a little dirty like if it was previously used.\\n- ID: B0BBGNYHB5, review: Espectacular producto Tamaño adecuado, y buen material\\n- ID: B0BBGNYHB5, review: Love Super cute!!

Thankfully, this pair gets all three right.<br /><br />First, they generally feel nice and are quite easy to wear. I've had some that really bothered my ear canals, but this are a good fit, snug without feeling like a plug in my ears.<br /><br />Second, sound quality is very good for earbuds. You don't get the rich, full bass of over-the-ear phones, but the sound is generally good overall, without the thin mids and tinny highs so common with earbuds. Thumbs up.<br /><br />Finally, the extra bells and whistles, such as an in-line mic and controls right on the bids are pretty nice. They're not something I need a lot, but they're a nice extra to have. In fact, for many people they are what will justify the price tag.<br /><br />Overall, thumbs up.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: Very impressed Needed a new pair of earbuds to put in my travel bag. Decided to go with these, not disappointed.<br /><br />They come in a nice box that includes a travel bag, multiple ear tips, and a 4-pole to dual 3-pole adaptor (Combo Mic/Headphone to individual Mic and Headphone).<br /><br />The cables have some sort of rubberized coating. They make it feel more durable, but I would have preferred a cloth coating instead. The rubber coating likes to grab on stuff.<br /><br />The earbuds themselves feel like solid aluminum. The back ends are labelled 'L' and 'R' as you would expect. They are also slightly magnetic so you can put them together back-to-back. I am not sure if the magnetism is just because of the drivers or if they actually put magnets in the housing for this use.<br /><br />The sound is very good for $50 earbuds. Right out of the box I listened to a couple podcasts and then transitioned into some music. Highs are good, the middles are a little muddy, and the bass is very prominent. These have the sound profile you would expect from Beats or other very popular headphone brands. Listening to them for 4+ hours at a time did not fatigue my ears like other cheap earbuds I have used. Nor did they hurt my ear canals, a total win there.<br /><br />These are not going to replace my Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro's, but they are perfect to travel with. I even had a couple cases where I went to stand up from my desk and reached up to take off my DT770's forgetting I was actually using these earbuds.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: These Aren't Just for Gamers These wired earbuds address my base fixations:<br />* Muddy sound. Since my hearing began a gentle decline years ago, I’m not willing to spend more for anything that delivers quiet, understandable videos and phone conversations at low decibels.<br />* Klunky accessories. Attachments that stick out too far are a pain to retrieve from pockets. They get snagged catch on everything. That’s why I use only right-angle plugs.<br />* Long Day Comfort. I hate ill-fit cushions and buds that won’t stay in place when I’m moving.<br /><br />Outside of the items above, I’m malleable.<br /><br />I was pleased to discover that:<br />* Soft “shark-fins” do a fine job of securing the buds in ears.<br />* Kasott’s in-line mic control smoothly controlled volume, mute, and on/off (aka, answer/disconnect).<br /><br />Although flat cable is my tangle-free preference, the cladding on the Pro V1 round cable had a relatively solid feel. Its wire clip is small enough to grip the Columbia label on my shirt pocket.<br /><br />The earbuds performed nicely with Android phones, Windows laptops and my Anker PowerConf S3; however, they did not work with my belt-mount voice amp. (I know, I know. The amp needs a mono connection.)<br /><br />I haven’t had these long enough to comment on durability, beyond the visible build quality. Fit and finish are impressive.<br /><br />Regarding Gaming: I don’t. Sorry.<br /><br />All in all, these look, feel and act like above average wired earbuds should.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: These 3.5mm wired earbuds didn't disappoint my teen son. My son prefers wired earbuds over an actual headset or wireless earbuds. These work great according to my son. They fit comfortably in his ear and don't fall out. They don't irritate him. He uses them with xbox controller and his phone. The audio quality is not the greatest but definitely better than a lot of wired earbuds he has. He really likes the mic. He's soft spoken and tends to have trouble with people hearing him. He doesn't have that issue using this set of earbuds. I think these are a bit expensive but my son thinks they aren't provided they are durable. Only time will tell. I'm really happy these are 3.5mm plug as advertised and he doesn't need an adapter.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: Good deep sound To me, the bass sound is the most important and having mini drivers that are also doubling down as magnetic holds, I always call into question, but these worked just fine and I was very happy with the sound. Good deep bass and I definitely liked that it picked up the smallest sounds during gaming, I was surprisingly impressed\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: Worth the buy I was skeptical about these but man are they worth it. They are loud and have good sound quality. Perfect for shooter games.  I just cant tell you how the mic is. I never use it.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: Sound is good.

This is the perfect size to accommodate a Switch in a hard case! Great for taking it to a friend's house.  We often use the switch on car rides and needed more protection so that my 7-year-old could carry it to and from the car with fewer worries about drops. I love the size and the materials feel very quality, plus the design is adorable.  I haven't tested it but you can feel that it's been waterproofed yet it doesn't have any gross plastic smell! The padding feels good and the strap is quality nylon almost like a seatbelt.  They really went above and beyond.  Love it!<br /><br />I chose this product for free through Amazon Vine for an unbiased review and my thoughts are my own.\\n- ID: B0BTRV8DMV, review: Nice quality! Using for an Xbox I bought this for my daughter's Xbox. I liked the compartments and features better than other bags out there. I ordered yesterday and got it today! I opened it right away and tested my daughter's console and controller. Everything fits great and I feel like it's all safe inside. I would recommend this product. I have no complaints!  :)\\n- ID: B0BTRV8DMV, review: Simple effective case. It's nice to have all my PS5 stuff in one place while travelling.<br />It's not so nice to advertise in bright letters and graphics that I have all my PS5 stuff in one place.<br />It's nice to have disc storage.<br />It's not so nice to take those discs out of their cases to use it.<br />It's nice to have a place for my cords, (HDMI, power, and charging.)<br />It's not so nice that they are loose and the cables may fall out\\n- ID: B0BR7NT37B, review: Awesome Game Bag [[VIDEOID:a91558beefe08852581da0f980832c45]] I love this bag. It was more than I expected. It’s bigger than what I thought it would be and pleasantly surprised. It has two pockets for your switch and accessories, and it has an interior zippered pocket as well. My switch fit perfectly and has so much room for so much more. The charging cable fits, numerous games and so much more. It’s so roomy. The shoulder strap is adjustable which is important. All in all, I love it, and I posted plenty of photos and a video to show you the size and how great it is. I highly recommend this bag for any switch lover, especially an animal crossing lover. It’s perfect.\\n- ID: B0BTRV8DMV, review: Gets the job done on a budget. This is labeled a carrying case, but I feel it should be labeled carrying bag. It’s a little flimsy, but still holds the Ps5 and keeps it safe. Strong zipper, durable material. Not the highest quality bag, but it also costs a lot less than other options. If you’re just taking your Ps5 to a friends house or something, this is more than sufficient. I like the Ps5 logo on the outside… let’s all those Ps4 players know you’re cooler than them! 😎\\n- ID: B0BR7NT37B, review: Photo isn’t as vibrant The print isn’t as vibrant as the photos on the product show. It looks like ink is bleeding around the leaf print and it’s not as crisp as I thought it was gonna be. Overall wouldn’t repurchase again.

Thankfully, this pair gets all three right.<br /><br />First, they generally feel nice and are quite easy to wear. I've had some that really bothered my ear canals, but this are a good fit, snug without feeling like a plug in my ears.<br /><br />Second, sound quality is very good for earbuds. You don't get the rich, full bass of over-the-ear phones, but the sound is generally good overall, without the thin mids and tinny highs so common with earbuds. Thumbs up.<br /><br />Finally, the extra bells and whistles, such as an in-line mic and controls right on the bids are pretty nice. They're not something I need a lot, but they're a nice extra to have. In fact, for many people they are what will justify the price tag.<br /><br />Overall, thumbs up.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: Very impressed Needed a new pair of earbuds to put in my travel bag. Decided to go with these, not disappointed.<br /><br />They come in a nice box that includes a travel bag, multiple ear tips, and a 4-pole to dual 3-pole adaptor (Combo Mic/Headphone to individual Mic and Headphone).<br /><br />The cables have some sort of rubberized coating. They make it feel more durable, but I would have preferred a cloth coating instead. The rubber coating likes to grab on stuff.<br /><br />The earbuds themselves feel like solid aluminum. The back ends are labelled 'L' and 'R' as you would expect. They are also slightly magnetic so you can put them together back-to-back. I am not sure if the magnetism is just because of the drivers or if they actually put magnets in the housing for this use.<br /><br />The sound is very good for $50 earbuds. Right out of the box I listened to a couple podcasts and then transitioned into some music. Highs are good, the middles are a little muddy, and the bass is very prominent. These have the sound profile you would expect from Beats or other very popular headphone brands. Listening to them for 4+ hours at a time did not fatigue my ears like other cheap earbuds I have used. Nor did they hurt my ear canals, a total win there.<br /><br />These are not going to replace my Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro's, but they are perfect to travel with. I even had a couple cases where I went to stand up from my desk and reached up to take off my DT770's forgetting I was actually using these earbuds.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: These Aren't Just for Gamers These wired earbuds address my base fixations:<br />* Muddy sound. Since my hearing began a gentle decline years ago, I’m not willing to spend more for anything that delivers quiet, understandable videos and phone conversations at low decibels.<br />* Klunky accessories. Attachments that stick out too far are a pain to retrieve from pockets. They get snagged catch on everything. That’s why I use only right-angle plugs.<br />* Long Day Comfort. I hate ill-fit cushions and buds that won’t stay in place when I’m moving.<br /><br />Outside of the items above, I’m malleable.<br /><br />I was pleased to discover that:<br />* Soft “shark-fins” do a fine job of securing the buds in ears.<br />* Kasott’s in-line mic control smoothly controlled volume, mute, and on/off (aka, answer/disconnect).<br /><br />Although flat cable is my tangle-free preference, the cladding on the Pro V1 round cable had a relatively solid feel. Its wire clip is small enough to grip the Columbia label on my shirt pocket.<br /><br />The earbuds performed nicely with Android phones, Windows laptops and my Anker PowerConf S3; however, they did not work with my belt-mount voice amp. (I know, I know. The amp needs a mono connection.)<br /><br />I haven’t had these long enough to comment on durability, beyond the visible build quality. Fit and finish are impressive.<br /><br />Regarding Gaming: I don’t. Sorry.<br /><br />All in all, these look, feel and act like above average wired earbuds should.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: These 3.5mm wired earbuds didn't disappoint my teen son. My son prefers wired earbuds over an actual headset or wireless earbuds. These work great according to my son. They fit comfortably in his ear and don't fall out. They don't irritate him. He uses them with xbox controller and his phone. The audio quality is not the greatest but definitely better than a lot of wired earbuds he has. He really likes the mic. He's soft spoken and tends to have trouble with people hearing him. He doesn't have that issue using this set of earbuds. I think these are a bit expensive but my son thinks they aren't provided they are durable. Only time will tell. I'm really happy these are 3.5mm plug as advertised and he doesn't need an adapter.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: Good deep sound To me, the bass sound is the most important and having mini drivers that are also doubling down as magnetic holds, I always call into question, but these worked just fine and I was very happy with the sound. Good deep bass and I definitely liked that it picked up the smallest sounds during gaming, I was surprisingly impressed\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: Worth the buy I was skeptical about these but man are they worth it. They are loud and have good sound quality. Perfect for shooter games.  I just cant tell you how the mic is. I never use it.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: Sound is good.

This is the perfect size to accommodate a Switch in a hard case! Great for taking it to a friend's house.  We often use the switch on car rides and needed more protection so that my 7-year-old could carry it to and from the car with fewer worries about drops. I love the size and the materials feel very quality, plus the design is adorable.  I haven't tested it but you can feel that it's been waterproofed yet it doesn't have any gross plastic smell! The padding feels good and the strap is quality nylon almost like a seatbelt.  They really went above and beyond.  Love it!<br /><br />I chose this product for free through Amazon Vine for an unbiased review and my thoughts are my own.\\n- ID: B0BTRV8DMV, review: Nice quality! Using for an Xbox I bought this for my daughter's Xbox. I liked the compartments and features better than other bags out there. I ordered yesterday and got it today! I opened it right away and tested my daughter's console and controller. Everything fits great and I feel like it's all safe inside. I would recommend this product. I have no complaints!  :)\\n- ID: B0BTRV8DMV, review: Simple effective case. It's nice to have all my PS5 stuff in one place while travelling.<br />It's not so nice to advertise in bright letters and graphics that I have all my PS5 stuff in one place.<br />It's nice to have disc storage.<br />It's not so nice to take those discs out of their cases to use it.<br />It's nice to have a place for my cords, (HDMI, power, and charging.)<br />It's not so nice that they are loose and the cables may fall out\\n- ID: B0BR7NT37B, review: Awesome Game Bag [[VIDEOID:a91558beefe08852581da0f980832c45]] I love this bag. It was more than I expected. It’s bigger than what I thought it would be and pleasantly surprised. It has two pockets for your switch and accessories, and it has an interior zippered pocket as well. My switch fit perfectly and has so much room for so much more. The charging cable fits, numerous games and so much more. It’s so roomy. The shoulder strap is adjustable which is important. All in all, I love it, and I posted plenty of photos and a video to show you the size and how great it is. I highly recommend this bag for any switch lover, especially an animal crossing lover. It’s perfect.\\n- ID: B0BTRV8DMV, review: Gets the job done on a budget. This is labeled a carrying case, but I feel it should be labeled carrying bag. It’s a little flimsy, but still holds the Ps5 and keeps it safe. Strong zipper, durable material. Not the highest quality bag, but it also costs a lot less than other options. If you’re just taking your Ps5 to a friends house or something, this is more than sufficient. I like the Ps5 logo on the outside… let’s all those Ps4 players know you’re cooler than them! 😎\\n- ID: B0BR7NT37B, review: Photo isn’t as vibrant The print isn’t as vibrant as the photos on the product show. It looks like ink is bleeding around the leaf print and it’s not as crisp as I thought it was gonna be. Overall wouldn’t repurchase again.

Thankfully, this pair gets all three right.<br /><br />First, they generally feel nice and are quite easy to wear. I've had some that really bothered my ear canals, but this are a good fit, snug without feeling like a plug in my ears.<br /><br />Second, sound quality is very good for earbuds. You don't get the rich, full bass of over-the-ear phones, but the sound is generally good overall, without the thin mids and tinny highs so common with earbuds. Thumbs up.<br /><br />Finally, the extra bells and whistles, such as an in-line mic and controls right on the bids are pretty nice. They're not something I need a lot, but they're a nice extra to have. In fact, for many people they are what will justify the price tag.<br /><br />Overall, thumbs up.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: Very impressed Needed a new pair of earbuds to put in my travel bag. Decided to go with these, not disappointed.<br /><br />They come in a nice box that includes a travel bag, multiple ear tips, and a 4-pole to dual 3-pole adaptor (Combo Mic/Headphone to individual Mic and Headphone).<br /><br />The cables have some sort of rubberized coating. They make it feel more durable, but I would have preferred a cloth coating instead. The rubber coating likes to grab on stuff.<br /><br />The earbuds themselves feel like solid aluminum. The back ends are labelled 'L' and 'R' as you would expect. They are also slightly magnetic so you can put them together back-to-back. I am not sure if the magnetism is just because of the drivers or if they actually put magnets in the housing for this use.<br /><br />The sound is very good for $50 earbuds. Right out of the box I listened to a couple podcasts and then transitioned into some music. Highs are good, the middles are a little muddy, and the bass is very prominent. These have the sound profile you would expect from Beats or other very popular headphone brands. Listening to them for 4+ hours at a time did not fatigue my ears like other cheap earbuds I have used. Nor did they hurt my ear canals, a total win there.<br /><br />These are not going to replace my Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro's, but they are perfect to travel with. I even had a couple cases where I went to stand up from my desk and reached up to take off my DT770's forgetting I was actually using these earbuds.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: These Aren't Just for Gamers These wired earbuds address my base fixations:<br />* Muddy sound. Since my hearing began a gentle decline years ago, I’m not willing to spend more for anything that delivers quiet, understandable videos and phone conversations at low decibels.<br />* Klunky accessories. Attachments that stick out too far are a pain to retrieve from pockets. They get snagged catch on everything. That’s why I use only right-angle plugs.<br />* Long Day Comfort. I hate ill-fit cushions and buds that won’t stay in place when I’m moving.<br /><br />Outside of the items above, I’m malleable.<br /><br />I was pleased to discover that:<br />* Soft “shark-fins” do a fine job of securing the buds in ears.<br />* Kasott’s in-line mic control smoothly controlled volume, mute, and on/off (aka, answer/disconnect).<br /><br />Although flat cable is my tangle-free preference, the cladding on the Pro V1 round cable had a relatively solid feel. Its wire clip is small enough to grip the Columbia label on my shirt pocket.<br /><br />The earbuds performed nicely with Android phones, Windows laptops and my Anker PowerConf S3; however, they did not work with my belt-mount voice amp. (I know, I know. The amp needs a mono connection.)<br /><br />I haven’t had these long enough to comment on durability, beyond the visible build quality. Fit and finish are impressive.<br /><br />Regarding Gaming: I don’t. Sorry.<br /><br />All in all, these look, feel and act like above average wired earbuds should.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: These 3.5mm wired earbuds didn't disappoint my teen son. My son prefers wired earbuds over an actual headset or wireless earbuds. These work great according to my son. They fit comfortably in his ear and don't fall out. They don't irritate him. He uses them with xbox controller and his phone. The audio quality is not the greatest but definitely better than a lot of wired earbuds he has. He really likes the mic. He's soft spoken and tends to have trouble with people hearing him. He doesn't have that issue using this set of earbuds. I think these are a bit expensive but my son thinks they aren't provided they are durable. Only time will tell. I'm really happy these are 3.5mm plug as advertised and he doesn't need an adapter.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: Good deep sound To me, the bass sound is the most important and having mini drivers that are also doubling down as magnetic holds, I always call into question, but these worked just fine and I was very happy with the sound. Good deep bass and I definitely liked that it picked up the smallest sounds during gaming, I was surprisingly impressed\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: Worth the buy I was skeptical about these but man are they worth it. They are loud and have good sound quality. Perfect for shooter games.  I just cant tell you how the mic is. I never use it.\\n- ID: B0C77XMZ4K, review: Sound is good.

This is the perfect size to accommodate a Switch in a hard case! Great for taking it to a friend's house.  We often use the switch on car rides and needed more protection so that my 7-year-old could carry it to and from the car with fewer worries about drops. I love the size and the materials feel very quality, plus the design is adorable.  I haven't tested it but you can feel that it's been waterproofed yet it doesn't have any gross plastic smell! The padding feels good and the strap is quality nylon almost like a seatbelt.  They really went above and beyond.  Love it!<br /><br />I chose this product for free through Amazon Vine for an unbiased review and my thoughts are my own.\\n- ID: B0BTRV8DMV, review: Nice quality! Using for an Xbox I bought this for my daughter's Xbox. I liked the compartments and features better than other bags out there. I ordered yesterday and got it today!

I have no complaints!  :)\\n- ID: B0BTRV8DMV, review: Simple effective case. It's nice to have all my PS5 stuff in one place while travelling.<br />It's not so nice to advertise in bright letters and graphics that I have all my PS5 stuff in one place.<br />It's nice to have disc storage.<br />It's not so nice to take those discs out of their cases to use it.<br />It's nice to have a place for my cords, (HDMI, power, and charging.)<br />It's not so nice that they are loose and the cables may fall out\\n- ID: B0BR7NT37B, review: Awesome Game Bag [[VIDEOID:a91558beefe08852581da0f980832c45]] I love this bag. It was more than I expected. It’s bigger than what I thought it would be and pleasantly surprised. It has two pockets for your switch and accessories, and it has an interior zippered pocket as well. My switch fit perfectly and has so much room for so much more. The charging cable fits, numerous games and so much more. It’s so roomy. The shoulder strap is adjustable which is important. All in all, I love it, and I posted plenty of photos and a video to show you the size and how great it is. I highly recommend this bag for any switch lover, especially an animal crossing lover. It’s perfect.\\n- ID: B0BTRV8DMV, review: Gets the job done on a budget. This is labeled a carrying case, but I feel it should be labeled carrying bag. It’s a little flimsy, but still holds the Ps5 and keeps it safe. Strong zipper, durable material. Not the highest quality bag, but it also costs a lot less than other options. If you’re just taking your Ps5 to a friends house or something, this is more than sufficient. I like the Ps5 logo on the outside… let’s all those Ps4 players know you’re cooler than them! 😎\\n- ID: B0BR7NT37B, review: Photo isn’t as vibrant The print isn’t as vibrant as the photos on the product show. It looks like ink is bleeding around the leaf print and it’s not as crisp as I thought it was gonna be. Overall wouldn’t repurchase again.
